# INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS IN THE U.S.

## Problem Statement and Questions Addressed
The goal of this project is to analyze international student trends in the United States from 2000 to 2022. As international students play a crucial role in shaping university demographics and labor market dynamics, in this study I will answer the following questions:

1.	How does international student enrollment compare to U.S. student enrollment?
2.	From which continents do most international students come from?
3.	Which fields of study are the most common among international students?
4.	Which academic areas are driving OPT (Optional Practical Training) participation?
5.	What hidden trends exist in terms of field growth, volatility, or shifts in student preferences?
6.	What fields of study follow a similar trend pattern?
7.	Which are the msot unstable or volatile fields of study among international students?



## Data Source üóÇÔ∏è
The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/webdevbadger/international-student-demographics?select=origin.csv), which includes information about international student demographics in the United States. In this Kaggle dataset you can find multiple CSV files covering student academic data, origins, funding sources, and visa status.
